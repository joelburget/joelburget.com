# Joel Burget

I'm a software developer working on developer productivity at Google.

## My beliefs, likes, and interests

My beliefs are broadly similar to those of the rationalist / effective altruist community. I believe most of humanity hasn't been born yet so it's important to make the world a better place for future generations. You might say I'm a [longtermist](https://80000hours.org/articles/future-generations/).

I've recently been focused on AI alignment, though I'm also interested in machine learning and functional programming.
