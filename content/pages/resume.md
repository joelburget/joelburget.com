## Work:

* Google - Software Engineer (August 2019 - March 2023): I was tech lead for an engineering productivity team, building tools to help our partner teams within Google.

  - I built a tool projected to save many engineer-years (per year) by using static analysis to anticipate common failures before changes are committed (and code is run).
  - I mentored engineers new to the team (and to Google) and helped prioritize projects and our technical choices.
  - Iâ€™ve built performance, integration, and regression testing tools that run as part of every deploy.
  - I had a 20% project with the quantum computing team, building tools used to design chip layouts.

* Monic - Cofounder (Feb 2018 - July 2019): Mostly focused on building the [Pact property checking system](https://github.com/monic-co/blog/blob/master/src/pages/introducing-the-pact-property-checker/index.md).
* JP Morgan - New Product Development Engineer - Vice President (Feb 2016 - Feb 2018): I worked on adding Raft-based consensus to the Ethereum Virtual Machine / Blockchain. Before that I worked on a functional programming language called Hopper.
* Consultant (Oct 2015 - Feb 2016): I worked as a front-end web consultant with a specialiation in React / Flux. I worked with Spring (now part of Shoprunner) where I built their web search feature and AlphaSheets where I helped with architecture and best practices.
* Khan Academy - Software Developer (2011-2015): I worked on many things during my time at Khan Academy -- search / autocomplete, tooling, frontend UI, etc. Full-stack Python / JavaScript web development.

## Projects:

## Noteworthy / significant contributions:

Unfortunately most of my paid work is not open-source. However, I do have some public projects I'm proud of.

* [khan/react-components](https://github.com/khan/react-components): React components originally from within Khan Academy that I open-sourced. This is the first example that I know of publishing React components on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), now standard practice.
* [Khan/perseus](https://github.com/Khan/perseus): Khan Academy's exercise editing system. I wrote the integration between Perseus and the main website. Creating and saving exercises; creating, saving, moving, renaming questions within an exercise.
* [Khan/KAS](https://github.com/Khan/KAS): Khan Academy's computer algebra system. I created simple physics / units of measure support, so you can, say, answer a question in /kg/, when the answer was originally stated in /g/.
* [joelburget/react-live-editor](https://github.com/joelburget/react-live-editor): A tool for live editing react components in the browser, used on the react-components [landing page](http://khan.github.io/react-components/).
* [joelburget/react-haskell](https://github.com/joelburget/react-haskell): Bindings in Haskell for Facebook's React JavaScript library. It works well considering that it's Haskell running in the browser to drive UIs. But this is the project where I learned when to quit.  I wrote about using react-haskell for user interfaces [on my website](http://joelburget.com/react-haskell/).
* [joelburget/haste-compiler:commonjs](https://github.com/joelburget/haste-compiler/tree/commonjs): I took an existing Haskell-to-JavaScript compiler and integrated it with conventional JavaScript tools (CommonJS modules), so that you can more easily use Haskell and JavaScript together.

## Education:

BS Mathematics, BS Computer and Information Science with honors. Spring 2012, Ohio State University.
